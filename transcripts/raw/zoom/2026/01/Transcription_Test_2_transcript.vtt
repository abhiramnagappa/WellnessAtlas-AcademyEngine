00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Ankur Gupta: Okay, I have enabled captions now as the host.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Ankur Gupta: And AI Companion is, uh, started for this meeting, I think, by default.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Ankur Gupta: And I'm going to have to have another participant join.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Ankur Gupta: And check the behavior for them.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Ankur Gupta: And, uh, find out if, uh, I can get access to the…

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Ankur Gupta: Transcripts, once the meeting is over, or do I have to…

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Ankur Gupta: Record this meeting, or do something else to access the transcripts.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Ankur Gupta: I'm gonna have… I'm gonna have another participant join you.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Abhiram B.N.: Okay, as a participant, when I log in to this meeting, I see that I see a pop-up saying that the meeting is.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Abhiram B.N.: being transcribed with the A Companion.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Abhiram B.N.: And, uh, by default, I don't see any captions, but I do have the options to show CC.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Abhiram B.N.: which I can click on, and then I can see the captions, uh…

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Abhiram B.N.: Which, uh, for the things that I'm speaking, so I can still see the captions for what I'm speaking. Let me see, uh, let me…

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Abhiram B.N.: Speakers, the host and find what's the behavior.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Ankur Gupta: Okay, one of the things I am seeing, uh, with the captions being generated is that, uh.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Ankur Gupta: They are not of the highest quality.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Ankur Gupta: Especially when I'm speaking too fast.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Ankur Gupta: And I'm a little suspicious about the quality of the transcripts.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Ankur Gupta: If somebody is speaking in a manner that is not, uh…

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Ankur Gupta: Completely…

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Ankur Gupta: clear, uh…

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Ankur Gupta: And I'm not sure of what happens either mehindi me bath kuru, Hindi or English mix karthi bath karu.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Ankur Gupta: behavior kia.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Ankur Gupta: So, this is going to be an important factor.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Ankur Gupta: And, uh…

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Ankur Gupta: In fact, what I'm seeing is…

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Ankur Gupta: The participants can…

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Ankur Gupta: see the captions when other participants were speaking. They can't do anything with it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Ankur Gupta: They cannot download it, they can sequence. I don't think that's a problem, but as I thought earlier.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Ankur Gupta: It is not, like, participants cannot see the captions for other speakers.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Ankur Gupta: Okay, I will end the meeting now, and let's see if I have access to the transcripts.
